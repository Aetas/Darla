Darla the Robot. I don't know why I named her Darla but she's the sweetest thing West of the Mississippi.

Made as a project in Electronics Design Lab

Simulations are made with LTSpice IV. Sometimes the comparator op-amp likes to claim it's missing but that's fine since we don't ask much of it - just use any other general purpose op-amp.

Programming is done in the Arduino IDE. Nothing really fancy, honestly.

MIT Open License is really just so anybody else taking the class is obligated to say it's not their work if they decide to google answers to their assignments.
